# Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Rating Prediction
## Problem Description
Bengaluru, known for its diverse culinary scene, hosts a plethora of restaurants offering cuisines from all around the world. With approximately 12,000 restaurants and counting, the competition in the food industry is fierce. New restaurants face challenges such as high real estate costs, rising food prices, and a shortage of quality manpower. To aid new ventures in making informed decisions about location, theme, menu, and more, this project utilizes Zomato data to analyze the demographics and preferences of different neighborhoods in Bengaluru. The goal is to predict the ratings of restaurants based on various features.

## Problem Statement
Can we predict the rating of a restaurant based on parameters such as average cost for two people, availability of online ordering, types of cuisines offered, menu items, and popular dishes? This project aims to develop a regression model to predict restaurant ratings using Zomato's restaurant data.

## Real-world/Business Objectives
Assist new restaurants in making strategic decisions regarding location, theme, and menu.
Provide insights into the demographics and food preferences of different neighborhoods in Bengaluru.
Predict the ratings of restaurants to help customers make informed dining choices.
## Machine Learning Formulation
This project tackles the problem of predicting restaurant ratings, making it a regression problem. By leveraging features such as average cost, online ordering availability, cuisine types, and menu items, we aim to develop a regression model that accurately predicts restaurant ratings.

## Performance Metric
The performance of the regression model will be evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. The goal is to minimize MSE, with an ideal value of 0 indicating perfect prediction accuracy.
